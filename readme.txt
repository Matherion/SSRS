 The first version was developed by
 Gjalt-Jorn Peters for the Dutch Open University
 in March 2013.
----------------------------------------------------

This system was developed to provide a simple
interface for students to request datafiles for
assignments. The system uses the student's id-number
to select one of several datafiles and then to select
a random subsample from the datafile.
